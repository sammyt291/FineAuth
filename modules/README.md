# Built-in modules

These modules are shipped as folders in the repository to avoid committing
binary assets. Use the build script to generate zip bundles locally.

Included module folders:
- landing/
- home/
- navigation/
- footer/

To generate zip bundles locally (ignored by git), run:

```bash
npm run build:modules
```
